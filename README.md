#AWS Candidate App

Build a sample web UI app to input ‘candidate info’ and a resume in a word file attachment.

- Save the candidate info to a RDS CandidateInfo table
- Save the word attachment in a S3 bucket with ‘key name’ that can be used to easily retrieve the document 
- Web UI Grid page to list all candidates & clicking on the name downloads the word file

We’ll let you get as creative as you would like to be given you deep knowledge in databases and optimization. E.g. If you have also learnt AWS lambda server less coding, see how you could incorporate that here.
